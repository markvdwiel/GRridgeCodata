Conservation is a potential useful co-data for GRridge modeling when micro-RNAseq is used as a primary data set. 

The conservation status of a miRNA that is divided into these following three classes, namely non-conserved (0), conserved across mammals (1) and broadly conserved, across most vertebrates (2). The list was taken from TargetScanHuman version 7.1 (Agarwal, et al., 2015). Our hypothesis is, markers which are broadly conserved are more important than the non-conserved markers in the GRridge model.
