
Cancer consensus genes is a potential useful co-data for GRridge modeling when RNAseq data set is used as a primary data set. 

DESCRIPTION:
The cancer Gene Census is an ongoing effort to catalogue those genes for which mutations 
have been causally implicated in cancer. The original census and analysis was published 
in Nature Reviews Cancer and supplemental analysis information related to the paper 
is also available.
The census is not static but rather is updated regularly/as needed. In particular we 
are grateful to Felix Mitelman and his colleagues in providing information on more genes 
involved in uncommon translocations in leukaemias and lymphomas. Currently, more than 1% 
of all human genes are implicated via mutation in cancer. Of these, approximately 90% 
have somatic mutations in cancer, 20% bear germline mutations that predispose to cancer 
and 10% show both somatic and germline mutations.

CO-DATA PROCESSING:
The "coDataProcessing_CancerConsensusGenes.R" provides an R script to process the cancer 
consensus genes information as a co-data for GRridge modeling.
