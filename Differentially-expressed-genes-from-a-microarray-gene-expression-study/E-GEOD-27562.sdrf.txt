GSM682143 1	Blood collection: Blood samples (8mL) collected by venipuncture into BD Vacutainer CPT Cell Preparation tubes. Samples processed within 2 hours of collection.	PBMC isolation: CPT tubes were centrifuged for 30 minutes at 2,500 rpms in a centrifuge with a swinging bucket rotor. The plasma layer was removed, and then the remaining buffy coat was poured into a 15 mL conical tube. Next, 5 mL of chilled phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) was added to the CPT tube, which was capped and inverted to mix. The contents were poured into the same 15 mL conical tube, which was then centrifuged for 10 minutes at 1200 rpms at room temperature. The supernatant was then aspirated and the pellet was resuspended in 1 mL of freezing media (RPMI with 20% DMSO and 20% FBS). The cells were then transferred to a cryovial (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) and placed in a freezer box at -80°C. After 24 hours samples were transferred to liquid nitrogen storage.	PBMCs from patients with diagnosis of invasive breast cancer, confirmed by diagnostic biopsy; sample taken following surgical excision of tumor.

GSM682130 1	Blood collection: Blood samples (8mL) collected by venipuncture into BD Vacutainer CPT Cell Preparation tubes. Samples processed within 2 hours of collection.	PBMC isolation: CPT tubes were centrifuged for 30 minutes at 2,500 rpms in a centrifuge with a swinging bucket rotor. The plasma layer was removed, and then the remaining buffy coat was poured into a 15 mL conical tube. Next, 5 mL of chilled phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) was added to the CPT tube, which was capped and inverted to mix. The contents were poured into the same 15 mL conical tube, which was then centrifuged for 10 minutes at 1200 rpms at room temperature. The supernatant was then aspirated and the pellet was resuspended in 1 mL of freezing media (RPMI with 20% DMSO and 20% FBS). The cells were then transferred to a cryovial (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) and placed in a freezer box at -80°C. After 24 hours samples were transferred to liquid nitrogen storage.

PBMC isolation: CPT tubes were centrifuged for 30 minutes at 2,500 rpms in a centrifuge with a swinging bucket rotor. The plasma layer was removed, and then the remaining buffy coat was poured into a 15 mL conical tube. Next, 5 mL of chilled phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) was added to the CPT tube, which was capped and inverted to mix. The contents were poured into the same 15 mL conical tube, which was then centrifuged for 10 minutes at 1200 rpms at room temperature. The supernatant was then aspirated and the pellet was resuspended in 1 mL of freezing media (RPMI with 20% DMSO and 20% FBS). The cells were then transferred to a cryovial (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) and placed in a freezer box at -80°C. After 24 hours samples were transferred to liquid nitrogen storage.

GSM681984 1	Blood collection: Blood samples (8mL) collected by venipuncture into BD Vacutainer CPT Cell Preparation tubes. Samples processed within 2 hours of collection.	PBMC isolation: CPT tubes were centrifuged for 30 minutes at 2,500 rpms in a centrifuge with a swinging bucket rotor. The plasma layer was removed, and then the remaining buffy coat was poured into a 15 mL conical tube. Next, 5 mL of chilled phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) was added to the CPT tube, which was capped and inverted to mix. The contents were poured into the same 15 mL conical tube, which was then centrifuged for 10 minutes at 1200 rpms at room temperature. The supernatant was then aspirated and the pellet was resuspended in 1 mL of freezing media (RPMI with 20% DMSO and 20% FBS). The cells were then transferred to a cryovial (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) and placed in a freezer box at -80°C. After 24 hours samples were transferred to liquid nitrogen storage.
