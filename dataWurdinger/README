DESCRIPTION:

Blood platelets extracted from patients with six different cancer types were used to
profile RNA markers for early cancer detection (Wurdinger et al., 2015). The
raw sequencing data set is publicly available in GEO database (GEO: GSE68086). 

This R object contains:
1. datWurdinger: A matrix containing preprocessed mRNA sequencing data 
(quasi-gausian scale). Columns are samples and rows are features. 

2. respWurdinger: A data frame containing sampleID and response for each sample.
The responses are "Breast", "CRC", "GBM", "HC", "LiverAndBile", "NSCLC" and "Pancreas".                

3. annotationWurdinger : A list containing ensembleID, geneSymbol,
entrezID and chromosome location. 

4. coDataWurdinger: A list containing co-data sets from external sources, 
namely (i) a list of genes that are expressed in platelets;
(ii) immunologic signature pathway and; (iii) transcription factor based pathway 
and a list of cancer somatic genes.

dataWurdinger and dataWurdingerBC differ in the sense that the latter contains the data and coData
obly Breast and Colon samples. For the latter features with sd=0 were removed.
