
DESCRIPTION: 

Gene sets that represent cell states and perturbations within the immune system. The 
signatures were generated by manual curation of published studies in human and mouse
immunology. For each study, pairwise comparisons of relevant classes were made and genes 
ranked by mutual information. Gene sets correspond to top or bottom genes (FDR < 0.25 or 
maximum of 200 genes) for each comparison.

Immunologic signatures collection (also called ImmuneSigDB) is composed of gene sets that
represent cell types, states, and perturbations within the immune system. The signatures 
were generated by manual curation of published studies in human and mouse immunology.
We first capture relevant microarray datasets published in the immunology literature that
have raw data deposited to Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). For each published study, the 
relevant comparisons are identified (e.g. WT vs. KO; pre- vs. post-treatment etc.) and 
brief, biologically meaningful descriptions are created. All data is processed and 
normalized the same way to identify the gene sets, which correspond to the top or bottom 
genes (FDR < 0.25 or maximum of 200 genes) ranked by mutual information for each 
assigned comparison.

The immunologic signatures collection was generated as part of our collaboration with the 
Haining Lab at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and the Human Immunology Project Consortium 
(HIPC). To cite your use of the collection, and for further information, please refer to

CO-DATA PROCESSING:
The "coDataProcessing_ImmunologicSignaturePathway" provides an R script to process the 
pathway information as a co-data for GRridge modeling in the RNAseq data set (primary data set).
